## About me
I have fun with web apps and football data often with the help of LLMs. I also love football ⚽. I want to use my skills in technology and otherwise to give back whatever I can to the game that has given me so much.

## Work
[My GitHub](https://github.com/PatrickJYKang) is a good portfolio of my projects. Previous experience also in CAD, robotics, competitive programming, and aeroplanes. 

I have also worked with football analysis both from video and data.

#### Current worklist:
- [https://github.com/PatrickJYKang/print-queue](https://github.com/PatrickJYKang/print-queue)
- [https://github.com/PatrickJYKang/patrickjykang](https://github.com/PatrickJYKang/patrickjykang)
- A fully free, web-based, and self-contained football video analysis app.

## My favourite repos
So you can get a better idea of my interests:
- [https://github.com/subhashhhhhh/Fastlytics](https://github.com/subhashhhhhh/Fastlytics). Easy to use, looks beautiful, and free.
- [https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR_data](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR_data). Not necessarily updating but still works great for 2024-25 data.
- [https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti]). Free and open source Minecraft.
- [https://profiled.streamlit.app/](https://profiled.streamlit.app/). Not open-sourced but one of my favourite apps to quickly get a hold of scouting targets and broad playstyle.
